# Social Media Backend

A backend API for quickly deploying a social media platform.

## Description

This is the backend for a social media site that uses MongoDB and Mongoose to store information on Users, their Thoughts and Reactions to their Thoughts. Models were created using Mongoose in the Models folder, while routing was done in the Controllers and Routes folders.

## Demo

The following GIF demonstrates the functionality of CRUD operations for Users:
